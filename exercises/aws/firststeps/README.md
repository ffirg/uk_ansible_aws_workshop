# Exercise 1 - Setup Access

Your custom environment has been prepared for you already. We'll go over some of the things that are in place.

## Step 1 - Login To Your Control Node

We have prepared a RHEL server for you to use, so go ahead and log in now.

```bash
ssh studentN@public_IP_address
```

Let's just check that Ansible is installed and working as expected:

```bash
do something here
```

This git repo has been cloned into your home directory already. Have a look under ~/uk_ansible_aws_workshop

Have a look at the exercises we'll be doing under exercises/aws

## Step 2 - Ansible Tower

This server also has Ansible Tower installed.

Go ahead and login now so we can check access:

```bash
tower url etc
```

This completes this exercise. In the next, we'll configure Ansible Tower with the necessary config.
